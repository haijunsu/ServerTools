I ran into this recently and I think I found an easy solution. I (only) tested it on Ubuntu 14.04.

First, uncomment this line /etc/default/lxc-net:

LXC_DHCP_CONFILE=/etc/lxc/dnsmasq.conf
In /etc/lxc/dnsmasq.conf, define a dhcp-hostsfile:

dhcp-hostsfile=/etc/lxc/dnsmasq-hosts.conf
Then add entries in /etc/lxc/dnsmasq-hosts.conf like this:

mail,10.0.3.16
web,10.0.3.17
Beware: changes will become effective after you have restarted lxc-net (which restarts dnsmasq):

service lxc-net restart
Afterwards you can modify /etc/lxc/dnsmasq-hosts.conf and send the SIGHUP signal to dnsmasq:

killall -s SIGHUP dnsmasq
So yes, you need to restart lxc-net, but only once. Hope this helps.
